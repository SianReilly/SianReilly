## Customer Solutions Engineer, Deepki. Environmental Earth Sciences (1st Class, Hons)

I analyse, interpret, and visualise real estate data to implement compelling platforms that empower data management and analysis at Deepki. I am self-motivated, work at pace to deliver high-quality projects, and am an effective communicator who can articulate complex scenarios to non-specialist audiences. After I graduated, I became the Lead ESG consultant at Onnu, an innovative biotechnology start-up in London.
